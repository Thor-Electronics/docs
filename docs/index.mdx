# Thor IoT Cloud Platform

Thor Electronics is an IoT platform providing blazing-fast cloud
services and scalable networks to businesses with a variety of use
cases.

## Creating Account

Creating a new account on Thor Electronics is pretty simple and
straight forward:

1. Head over [thor-electronics.ir/signup](https://thor-electronics.ir/signup).
2. Enter your phone number and choose a strong password for your account.
3. Submit the form and you're good to go.

## Obtaining API Token

API tokens are necessary when it comes to connect to the IoT network.
We can obtain an API token from Thor via API. Sending a `POST` request
to `/api/v1/auth` with payload containing `username` and `password`,
would result in signing in as a user and the response contains a JWT
token.
