# Thor IoT Cloud Platform

Thor Electronics is an IoT platform providing blazing-fast cloud
services and scalable networks to businesses with a variety of use
cases.

## Creating Account

Creating a new account on Thor Electronics is pretty simple and
straight forward:

1. Head over [thor-electronics.ir/signup](https://thor-electronics.ir/signup).
2. Enter your phone number and choose a strong password for your account.
3. Submit the form and you're good to go.

## Obtaining API Token

API tokens are necessary when it comes to connect to the IoT network.
We can obtain an API token from Thor via API. Sending a `POST` request
to `/api/v1/auth` with payload containing account username as
`identifier` and `password`, would result in signing in as a **user** and
the response contains a JWT token you can use to authenticate your
requests.

Alternatively you can login to your account via passing **email** or
**phone number** as `identifier` instead of **username** in your
request.

```JSON title="User Login HTTP Request Body"
{
  "identifier": "info@thor-electronics.com",
  "password": "mY-$ecret-p@ss"
}

// -- POST /api/v1/auth
```

:::

**Devices** can sign in via `/api/v1/auth/device` endpoint, by sending
`deviceId`, `cpuId`, `groupId`, and `ownerEmail` in the request
payload.

```JSON title="Device Login HTTP Request Body"
{
  "deviceId": "000000000000",
  "cpuId": "4738274832913421438219",
  "groupId": "000000000000",
  "ownerEmail": "info@thor-electronics.com"
}

// -- POST /api/v1/auth/device
```
