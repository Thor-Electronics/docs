## Group

A set of devices is called a group like a building, a room, a factory, a farm, a city, etc. Groups can hold multiple devices or sub-groups. Let's say a person has their home in an apartment. The apartment's a group including sub-groups and devices. Each room in a house is a sub-group of the house containing IoT devices in it. Actually groups are collections of devices that are somehow related to each other.
