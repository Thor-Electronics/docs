# Quickly Getting Started with Thor

We'll take a quick look at how we can easily and quickly start using
the system in a flash.

## Preparing the Account

In order to use Thor Electronics services, we need to have an account.

1. Signup for a new account at [thor-electronics.ir/signup](https://thor-electronics.ir/signup) and verify your phone number if prompted.
2. Create a new building by clicking on the **`Create Group`** button.
3. Add the first device on the building we've just created.
4. Done!

Now that we've set up our account, let's continue to setting up our
development environment.

## Development Environment

### API Token

Check out how you can
[Obtain an API Token as a User or a Device](/#obtaining-api-token).

### Connecting via Websockets

Thor, accepts websocket connections on `/api/v1/control` for devices
and `/api/v1/control/manage/{groupId}` for users. To manage a
[group](/concepts#group)(Building or something), use the manage
endpoint(2nd endpoint).

As soon as we stablish the websocket connection, Thor sends a message
to the client containing `AUTHENTICATE` signal.

```JSON title="Authentication Signal by Thor"
{ "signal": "AUTHENTICATE" }
```

This means Thor has accepted our connection and is now waiting for our
[authentication API token we've obtained before](/#obtaining-api-token)
to connect us to the proper cluster and hub.

So, we need to send our API token in a message:

```JSON
{
  "signal": "AUTHENTICATE",
  "payload": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
  }
}
```

:::caution
Thor will cancel the connection if we don't send the API token within
10 seconds.
:::

After we send the message, if there's no problem with the
authentication, thor will begin to send informative messages over the
websocket connection and connect us to the target cluster and hub.
Otherwise, we'll receive an authentication error message which means
there might be some problems with JSON parsing or the token might be
invalid or expired etc.
